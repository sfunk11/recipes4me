# recipes4me
A website for foodies to collect and save recipes.

## App Description
Recipes4me is your own personal cookbook.  You can use the recipe search feature to find recipes you will like, and save them to your cookbook. You can even dare to look for a random page of recipes to try out!  But, that's not all...you can also enter in the link to recipes you already love and they will be saved to your cookbook.

## How it works
 * On the main index page, you can either enter a search term in the top bar, or you can enter a recipe URL in the main box in the middle of the page.
 * When you enter a search term and click the "search" button, you will navigate to the search page, where cards will display names, links and basic ingredients for 10 recipes matching your search criteria.
* There is also an advanced search, which allows you to search both keyword and an ingredient.  Or, if you are feeling brave, you can "dare" to find a random page of 10 recipes.
* Choose to save any recipes you like to your cookbook. 
* When you click the CookBook button in the upper right corner,  you will navigate to the main cookbook page. Here you will see a list of all of your current saved recipes.
* Clicking on any of your saved recipes will bring up the recipe details in the main recipe card.
